- ### Count and Index
	- **.count()**
		- The `.count()` method is a tuple method in Python used to count the occurrences of a specific element in a tuple.
		- **Syntax:**
			```python
			.count(element)
			```
		- **Parameters:** 
			- `element`: The element whose occurrences are to be counted in the tuple.
		- **Return Value:** 
			- The method returns an integer value representing the number of occurrences of the specified `element` in the tuple.
		- **Description:** 
			- The `.count()` method is used to determine how many times a particular element appears in a tuple.
			- It takes the `element` as an argument and returns the count of occurrences of that element in the tuple.
			- If the `element` is not found in the tuple, the method returns `0`.
		- **Examples:**
			1. Counting occurrences of an element in a tuple:
				```python
				ages = (30, 25, 30, 40, 30)
				count_of_30 = ages.count(30)
				print(count_of_30)
				# Output: 3
				```
			2. Counting occurrences of a string in a tuple:
				```python
				names = ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'Alice')
				count_of_alice = names.count('Alice')
				print(count_of_alice)
				# Output: 3
				```
			3. Counting occurrences of a tuple in another tuple:
				```python
				t1 = (1, 2, 3)
				t2 = (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1)
				count_of_t1 = t2.count(t1)
				print(count_of_t1)
				# Output: 1
				```
	- **.index()**
		- The `.index()` method is a tuple method in Python used to find the index of the first occurrence of a specific element in a tuple.
		- **Syntax:**
			```python
			.index(element[, start[, end]])
			```
		- **Parameters:** 
			- `element`: The element whose index is to be found in the tuple.
			- `start` (optional): The index from which the search starts. If not provided, the search starts from the beginning of the tuple.
			- `end` (optional): The index at which the search ends. If not provided, the search continues until the end of the tuple.
		- **Return Value:** 
			- The method returns an integer value representing the index of the first occurrence of the specified `element` in the tuple.
		- **Description:** 
			- The `.index()` method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a particular element in a tuple.
			- It takes the `element` as an argument and returns the index where the first occurrence is found.
			- If the `element` is not found in the tuple, the method raises a `ValueError`.
			- The optional `start` and `end` parameters can be used to narrow down the search range within the tuple.
		- **Examples:**
			1. Finding the index of an element in a tuple:
				```python
				ages = (30, 25, 30, 40, 30)
				index_of_40 = ages.index(40)
				print(index_of_40)
				# Output: 3
				```
			2. Finding the index of an element within a specific range:
				```python
				names = ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'Alice')
				index_of_alice = names.index('Alice', 1, 4)
				print(index_of_alice)
				# Output: 2
				```
			3. Using `index()` with non-existent element:
				```python
				t = (1, 2, 3)
				try:
					index_of_4 = t.index(4)
					print(index_of_4)
				except ValueError:
					print("Element not found.")
				# Output: Element not found.
				```
